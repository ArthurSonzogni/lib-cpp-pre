  About it
  --------
  The pre library is a set of helper functions for common programming
  operations like bit shifting, byte array conversions, unaligned access to bits,
  as well as helper for stringifying enums, var_dump equivalent for C++ to print 
  any types and so on.

  This is a programming toolbox for Le CBNA & Fr. Sauter AG where all the reusable 
  codes which are missing in std:: or boost:: for common programming task are added
  there, until they get (if they ever can) into boost, and perhaps later in std::.

  Boost is the pre-std library for the world, pre is the pre-boost library for 
  Le CBNA & Fr. Sauter AG.

  Using it
